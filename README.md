which is a fork of the original, https://github.com/4RTools/4RTools

Changes:
* translated back into English
* adapted to fit OsRO MR
* renewal skills mostly removed
* padawan (jedi/sith) skills added, and skill icons added too!
* reverted from two toggle buttons (one for heal, other for all other macro) to just one again
* dark theme reverted back into a light theme (seems to match RO's client better)
* some of the form's UI modified
* most of the fonts (eventually all) changed to Segoe UI
