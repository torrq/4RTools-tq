# 4RTools-tq

## Overview
4RTools-tq is a fork of [TalesTools](https://github.com/biancaazuma/TalesTools), which was originally based on [4RTools](https://github.com/4RTools/4RTools). This project refines and adapts the tool for enhanced compatibility with OsRO MR.

## Key Changes
- **Language & Adaptation:** Re-translated back into English and adjusted to align with OsRO MR's status set.
- **Weight-Based Auto-Disable:** Added a setting to disable 4RTools when overweight (at 50% or 90%) and trigger an Alt-# macro.
- **Expanded Skill Support:** Included Padawan (Jedi/Sith) skills along with corresponding skill icons.
- **Pre-Renewal Focus:** Removed most Renewal skills to maintain compatibility.
- **Macro Toggle Simplification:** Reverted from two toggle buttons (one for heal, another for all other macros) back to a single toggle.
- **UI & Theming:** Reverted from a dark theme to a light theme to better match the RO client.
- **Miscellaneous Improvements:**
  - Various UI tweaks.
  - Updated NuGet packages.
  - Upgraded .NET framework from v4.7.2 to v4.8.1 to reduce build warnings.
