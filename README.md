# 4RTools-tq

Fork of: https://github.com/biancaazuma/TalesTools
Originally: https://github.com/4RTools/4RTools

Changes:
* Translated back into English, and adapted to fit OsRO MR's status set.
* New setting to disable 4RTools while overweight (50% or 90%) and shoot an Alt-# macro off.
* Renewal skills (mostly) removed.
* Padawan (Jedi/Sith) skills added, and skill icons added too!
* Reverted from two toggle buttons (one for heal, other for all other macro) to just one again.
* Dark theme reverted back into a light theme (seems to match RO's client better).
* Misc UI tweaks.
